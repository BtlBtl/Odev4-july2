        <div class="p">Simply put, camping is good for you, both in body and mind. Benefits include relationship building, opportunities to learn and develop new skills, unplugging and getting away from screens,
             connecting with nature, stress reduction, and increasing physical fitness. The fitness benefits of camping are well documented.Camping is an outdoor activity that involves staying the night/more than
              one night in a protective shelter out in nature. Camping is a broad term but in its essence, camping is a way of getting away from the hassle of urban life, to a more natural environment for a limited time.

            <div class="p2">Camping is fun because it's an experience. Not only do you engage with nature and wildlife, you're also leaving behind the stress and hustle of city life. As you set up tents, get the campfire
                 roaring, and learn about the world around you, you're making memories that will last a lifetime.</div>
